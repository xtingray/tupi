  <p class="title">Animation Module</p>

  <p class="paragraph">This is the module you will spend most of
  your time in when you are working with <b>Tupi</b>. You know why?
  This is where you will build each frame of your animation; every
  line of every character and every piece of the scenario for which
  you want to tell the story.<br>
  In other words, if you wanted to create an animation of a
  character walking down a street, this tab is where you will
  design the character and each of the positions in which it will
  appear as you move it.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">In the previous section, we looked at the
  general components of the <b>Tupi</b> interface. Now let&rsquo;s
  look in a little more detail at every resource available from
  this module.</p>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>1.</b> <b>Workspace area</b></p>

  <p class="paragraph">Think of the <i>workspace</i> as a blank
  canvas, the space available for the design of each of the frames
  that will be part of the animation. There are two ruler scales,
  one at the top and one the left. In the centre, there is a
  rectangular white background, representing the dimensions of the
  frame, or if you prefer, your &ldquo;paper&rdquo;. On the right
  side you willfind a dynamic panel that contains the properties of
  whichever tool is selected at that time and at the bottom, a
  small set of controls related to the <i>Workspace</i>.<br>
  <b>Tip:</b> Anything which does not draw into the frame, will not
  be visible in the animation.</p>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>2.</b> <b>Primary Editing Functions
  Panel</b><br>
  Located in the upper left of the <i>Workspace</i>, this panel
  offers all the usual basic editing features when working on an
  illustration; <i>Re-do, Undo, Copy, Paste, Cut, Delete, Group</i>
  and <i>Ungroup.</i><br>
  Additionally, it offers two more very useful options: a
  <i>Grid</i> to guide the illustrator, which can be activated or
  deactivated at will and <i>Onion Skin,</i> functionality that
  allows you to make the current frame semi-transparent in order to
  see drawings in previous and subsequent frames. We will delve
  more into the use of the latter in <a href=
  "chapter2.html">Chapter 2 -Let&rsquo;s make an example!</a></p>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>3.</b> <b>Tools Panel</b><br>
  This panel is located on the left edge of the <i>workspace</i>
  and provides you with the necessary tools to draw and perform
  special operations on your illustration. Each resource is grouped
  by type in the following sub-menus:</p>

  <ul class="paragraph">
    <li>Drawing Menu: This menu contains all the drawing tools,
    including: <i>Pencil, Ink, Eraser, Rectangle, Ellipse, Line,
    Polyline,</i> and the <i>Text</i> tool.</li>

    <li>Selection Menu: This menu includes the tool for <i>Node
    Selection,</i> which can alter the shape and trajectory of an
    object by editing of nodes, and the <i>Object Selection</i>
    tool which lets you move, rotate or scale any object that is
    selected from the <i>Workspace</i>.</li>

    <li>Fill Menu: This menu contains tools for <i>Contour Fill</i>
    and <i>Internal Fill</i> of selected objects from the colour
    that is defined in the <i>Colour Palette</i> at the time.</li>

    <li>View Menu: This menu contains the <i>Magnifying Glass</i>
    tool to zoom in or out of the frame being worked on and the
    <i>Drag</i> tool (better known as the
    <i>&ldquo;Hand&rdquo;</i>), which serves to grab and move the
    view of a frame when it is zoomed.</li>

    <li>Tweening Menu: TODO should this go in yet? is tweeining
    released</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>4.</b> <b>Left Sidebar</b></p>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>Colour Palette</b><br>
  As its name implies, this is the panel where you choose the
  colour that you want to draw with, regardless of the shape or
  form that you are working with. It is important to note that
  selecting a new colour will not change the colour of anything
  you&rsquo;ve already drawn, but everything you draw after selecting it
  will be in the new colour (until you choose another one).</p>

      </tr>
    </table>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>Tip:</b> Note that in addition to using
  single colours, you can also use <i>gradients,</i> i.e.
  combinations of colours that blend gradually on the same figure
  as in the following example, where the gradient starts as a light
  green and ends in black:</p>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>Pen Properties</b><br>
  The <i>Pen</i> in this context defines the qualities of the tool
  you&rsquo;ll use to draw, you may want to think of it as the type
  of pen tip or brush you&rsquo;re going to use. This panel allows
  you to modify characteristics of the brush, such as its
  thickness, the shape of the stroke ends and the continuity of the
  line (for example, you can make different types of dotted line,
  if you wish).</p>

    </table>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>Object Library</b><br>
  The function of this component is to store a copy of the figures
  or images that are part of your project that you want to reuse in
  other frames of the same animation or even in another project.
  This resource is useful for animations where you know some of the
  components that you have drawn will appear again and again.</p>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>5.</b> <b>Right Sidebar</b></p>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>Scene Manager</b><br>
  What is a scene? I&rsquo;ll try to give a simple definition: think of a
  movie or a TV commercial, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve noticed that
  they&rsquo;re always made up of small pieces shot separately and
  then arranged to tell the story? These fragments are usually
  easily recognised by changes in the position of the camera or the
  spectator&rsquo;s point of view.<br>
  Once this concept is clear, it&rsquo;s easy to explain this
  component, through this panel you will be able to create, modify
  or delete each of the scenes that you include in your animation
  project.<br>
  <b>Tip:</b> It is important that before you start your animation
  project, you have very clear idea of what scenes you will develop
  and in what order you&rsquo;re going to create them. Pay close
  attention to the advice in &ldquo;<a href="first.html">First
  things first!</a>&rdquo;.</p>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>Exposure Sheet</b><br>
  The <i>Exposure Sheet</i> is a vital resource to illustrate the
  sequence of the frames that are part of a scene. Through it, you
  can add or delete new frames and new layers to each of your
  scenes. Moreover, from this panel you are able to select frames
  to edit in the <i>Workspace</i> with a single click. This
  functionality combined with the <i>onion skin</i> feature in the
  Tools Panel, will offer the necessary elements to make your
  animations look fluid. This will be much easier to understand,
  after you review the example in <a href="chapter2.html">Chapter
  2</a> .</p>
