<p class="title">Player Module</p>
<p class="paragraph">Through this module you can take a look at
your project as you build. With this resource, you can detect which
parts of the timeline of your animation settings needed, add more
frames, or perhaps change the speed at which images you want to
flow, it all depends on you, remember you're the director!<br></p>

<p class="paragraph">Okay, let's see what are the tools that are
part of this module:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Control Panel</b><br>
If you've ever used a DVD recorder or a stereo, you probably
already know what the function of this component. That's right,
thanks to this set of buttons you can play, stop and return your
animation project as often as you want, which will surely be many,
it is based on continuous observation and careful your work, you
detect errors in your animation and make the respective
adjustments, making the result is more fluid and that over time,
your projects are more surprising.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b>Panel Properties</b><br>
This panel, located on the bottom of the <i>playback module,</i>
you will find the following resources:</p>
<ol class="paragraph">
<li><b>Information about the animation.</b> Specifically, the
<i>name of the scene</i> and the <i>total</i> number <i>of
frames</i> that form, in other words, the sum total of every frame
was drawn.</li>
<li><b>FPS Control.</b> We can define the speed of the animation,
using the parameter <i>frames per second (FPS: Frames Per
Second,</i> in English).<br>
<b>Tip:</b> The larger the value of this field, the faster will be
the animation and the smaller, slower will look.</li>
<li><b>Repeat option.</b> This small selection box represents the
ability to play our video indefinitely. That is, if we leave it
enabled and press the <i>Play</i> button, the animation is repeated
over and over until we decide to stop it.</li>
<li><b>Export option.</b> It allows us to make our animation
project in a video file. For a better understanding of this
feature, take a look at the section <a href="video_file.html">"Let's 
create a video file"</a>.</li>
