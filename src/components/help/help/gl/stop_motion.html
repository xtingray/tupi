  <p class="title">Stop Motion? "It&rsquo;s possible."</p>

  <p class="paragraph">As already mentioned in the <a href=
  "init.html">introduction</a> to this book, <i>Stop Motion</i>
  animation is a technique based on photographs. We say that the
  videos from these types of animation are usually pretty fun.
  Okay, now the big question, &ldquo;Can I do <i>Stop Motion</i>
  with <b>Tupi</b>?<br>
  The short answer is yes, however, the component dedicated to this
  subject still needs much work. For now, the interface allows
  simple animations, but our future goals are more ambitious.<br>
  For now, let&rsquo;s see how to create a short video using this
  technique:</p>

  <ol>
    <li class="paragraph">Get a digital camera. Since this kind of
    animation is based on photographs, the camera is vital.</li>

    <li class="paragraph">Build a script for your story, following
    the tips mentioned in the " <a href="first.html">First!
    chapter</a> "</li>

    <li class="paragraph">Get the resources you need for your
    story; objects, people, etc.</li>

    <li class="paragraph">Set up your camera at a fixed point (eg a
    table or a tripod) pointing towards the place where your scene
    will take place and make sure that the camera cannot move
    sideways. Arrange your resources at the scene, in their
    starting positions for the beginning of the animation.</li>

    <li class="paragraph">Begin taking photos, pausing to move the
    objects or people in the scene (according to movements that you
    defined in your script) in between each photo. Remember that
    every movement must be small, since the final smoothness of
    your animation depends on this.</li>

    <li class="paragraph">Once you&rsquo;ve captured every movement that
    you require for your scenes, connect your camera to your
    computer and upload all the photos into a folder on the
    PC.</li>

    <li class="paragraph">Open <b>Tupi</b> and <a href=
    "new.html">create a new project</a> .</li>

    <li class="paragraph">Now select the <i>Import</i> menu located
    at the top and choose the <i>Bitmap Array</i>. A dialog box
    opens, asking you to select the directory where you saved the
    pictures for your animation.

      </center>
    </li>

    <li class="paragraph">Pressing the <i>OK</i> button, the
    program will load each of your images in a separate frame and
    in alphabetical order.

        the director that contains the images</p>
      </center>
    </li>

    <li class="paragraph">If your images are very large, the
    program will be forced to resize them, and if there are many
    and are all larger than 1 MB, it is likely that your machine
    will run out of memory and the program may crash.

      </center>
    </li>

    <li class="paragraph">When the process of importing images is
    complete, you can take a look at your project in the
    <i>Animation</i> tab (the second from the left in the
    workspace).</li>

    <li class="paragraph">From this point, you have two options:
    you can export your project as a video file, or you can do some
    editing on the images if you want using the drawing tools.</li>

    <li class="paragraph">If you like what you saw and want to
    convert to video, return to the <i>Animation</i> tab and click
    the <i>Export</i> button located on the bottom panel.</li>

    <li class="paragraph">Follow the usual steps to export as
    described in "<a href="video_file.html">Let&rsquo;s create a video
    file</a> " and you&rsquo;re done. Your <i>Stop Motion</i> project is
    ready to be famous!</li>
