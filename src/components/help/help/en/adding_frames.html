<p class="title">Adding new frames</p>
<p class="paragraph">With our first frame finished, it's time to
add the next. To do this, we will use the <i>Exposure
Table,</i> located to the right of our <i>workspace.</i><br>
With the mouse, let's select the 2nd frame of Layer 1,
as shown in the image.</p>

</center>
<p class="paragraph">Each time we need a new frame to work with,
perform the same procedure. It's time to add our butterfly in a
new position, but first it's time to turn on <i>onion skinning</i>.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #49.</b> Activating Onion Skin</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">With this resource, we can use the previous
frame as a guide to where we place objects or how characters are
animated. Notice that before activating the <i>onion skin</i>,
Frame 2 was completely white? Well, now looks like tracing paper.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #50.</b> A feint image of the first frame
is visible in the second, thanks to the Onion</p>

<p class="paragraph">Based on information from the first frame,
redraw the butterfly, this time a little later.</p>

second frame</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">Ok, now add a third frame, but to give us a
better idea of how to go about drawing your character
as the animation progresses, we will also enable more visibility of
earlier frames (10 for this example) by increasing the number in the 
box for previous onion skin layers.</p>

</center>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Tip:</b> Remember that you can activate the
visibility of both earlier and later frames. Feel free to use
as many as you like. It is important to take advantage of this
functionality to make your animations look as smooth as
possible.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Now we continue with our third frame, exactly
the same steps we took earlier.</p>

Frame 3</p>

<p class="paragraph">At this point, chances are you're wondering
"How many frames will my animation need? Well, it's a very good
question, but one you will have to learn how to answer yourself, 
with time and lots and lots of practice. Only with experience will 
you learn to estimate how many frames will be needed for your projects. 
For now, we will draw as many as are needed to complete our script.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b>Tip:</b> For this small project was
necessary to draw 73 frames.</p>
<p class="paragraph">One important thing to note is that you should
not expect to draw the last frame in order to visualize how your
animation is running. In fact, it is good practice to review the
results every few frames, to ensure that the illustrations
you are shaping every second really correspond to what you have in
mind. <a href="preview_time.html">Let's take a look!</a></p>
