  <p class="title">Adding new frames</p>

  <p class="paragraph">With our first frame finished, it’s
  time to add the next. To do this, we will use the <i>Exposure
  Table,</i> located to the right of our <i>workspace.</i><br>
  With the mouse, let’s select the 2nd frame of Layer 1, as
  shown in the image.</p>

  <center>
    <table>
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="file:sketching17.png"></td>

        <td><img src="file:sketching18.png"></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 48.</b> Adding a new frame</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">Each time we need a new frame to work with,
  perform the same procedure. It’s time to add to our
  butterfly in a new position, but first it’s time to turn on
  <i>onion skinning</i></p>

  <center>
    <table>
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="file:sketching19.png"></td>

        <td><img src="file:sketching20.png"></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 49.</b> Activating Onion Skin</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">With this resource, we can use the previous
  frame as a guide to where we place objects or how characters are
  animated. Notice that before activating the <i>onion skin,</i>
  Frame 2 was completely white? Well, now looks it looks like
  tracing paper.</p>

  <center>
    <img src="file:sketching21.png">

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 50.</b> A feint image of the
    first frame is visible in the second, thanks to the Onion.</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">Based on information from the first frame,
  redraw the butterfly, this time a little later.</p>

  <center>
    <img src="file:sketching22.png">

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 51.</b> Drawing the butterfly in
    the second frame</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">OK, now add a third frame, but to give us a
  better idea of ​​how to go about drawing your
  character as the animation progresses, we will also enable more
  visibility of earlier frames (10 for this example) by increasing
  the number in the box for previous onion skin layers.</p>

  <center>
    <table>
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="file:sketching23.png"></td>

        <td><img src="file:sketching24.png"></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 52.</b> Making 10 previous onion
    layers visible</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>Tip:</b> Remember that you can activate
  the visibility of both earlier and later frames. Feel free to use
  as many as you like. It is important to take advantage of this
  functionality to make your animations look as smooth as
  possible.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">Now we continue with our third frame,
  exactly the same steps we took earlier.</p>

  <center>
    <img src="file:sketching25.png">

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 53.</b> Drawing the butterfly in
    frame # 3</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">At this point, chances are you’re
  wondering “How many frames will my animation need?”
  Well, it’s a very good question, but one you will have to
  learn how to answer yourself, with time and lots and lots of
  practice. Only with experience will you learn to estimate how may
  frames will be needed for your projects. For now, we will draw as
  many as are needed to complete our script.</p>

        <td><img src="file:sketching28.png"></td>

        <td><img src="file:sketching29.png"></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><img src="file:sketching30.png"></td>

        <td><img src="file:sketching31.png"></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 56.</b> Frame screenshots # 21, #
    31, # 45 and # 56</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>Tip:</b> For this small project it was
  necessary to draw 73 frames.</p>
<p class="paragraph">One important thing to note is that you
  should not expect to draw the last frame in order to visualise
  how your animation is running. In fact, it is good practice to
  review the results every few frames, to ensure that the
  illustrations you are shaping every second really correspond to
  what you have in mind. <a href="preview_time.html">Let’s
