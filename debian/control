Description: 2D vectorial/animation tool
 Tupi: Open 2D Magic  is a design  and  authoring tool for digital 
 artists  interested  in  2D  Animation,  offering  an   interface 
 experience  focused  on 8-100 years old kids. It's source code is 
 based on the KTooN project.
 Some of  its main  features are: basic illustration tools (shapes, 
 fill, text),  gradient tools, onion  skin, brushes  editor, pencil 
 with smoothness  support, basic  object library (for svg files and 
 raster images) and many others.
 Using its modules of Animation and Reproduction  you can export 2D
 projects to several formats as OGG, MPEG, AVI, MOV and SWF. 
 Additionally, the  option of  exporting  Image arrays as output is 
 available.
